# test-plan-03-specific-tests

Phase 3 of 3 in the test planning workflow. Defines the exact test cases to implement.

## Sequence

test-plan-01-overview → test-plan-02-analysis → **test-plan-03-specific-tests**

## Trigger

Automatically invoked after analysis is approved.

## What It Creates

Table for each testable part:
| Test Name | Arrange | Act | Assert |

- Exact inputs, not descriptions
- Exact expected outputs
- Blank rows between tests for readability

## Checkpoint

Presents parts ONE AT A TIME with Analysis + Tests together. Each requires approval.

## After Approval

Tests can be written mechanically from the specification.
